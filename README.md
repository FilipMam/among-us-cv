Dear Internet User!  
I hope this README finds you in a good health!
This repo contains the code of my page: [filipMam.pl](https://www.filipmam.pl).
  
Please do note that it's by no means an example of perfectally written app and clean code. It's a side projected I wanted to have fun with and test differnt frontend solutions (both when it comes to JS and CSS) so don't be suprised if you some hacking or spaghetti code ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  
  
Cheers!  
Filip
